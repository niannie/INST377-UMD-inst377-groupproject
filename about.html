        SnackTrack will help users monitor their fitness journeys by 
        providing an accessible platform to log their food, exercise, 
        and overall health metrics, allowing them to achieve their fitness 
        goals. Our proposed system will allow users to input personal 
        details such as their daily caloric intake and exercise routines, 
        and track them over time. The app will provide an easy-to-navigate 
        interface where users can log their meals and workouts, receive 
        feedback, and view progress through attractive visualizations. 
        We will use the Sport and Fitness API to access reliable nutrition 
        and fitness data for food items and exercises. This will simplify 
        the process for users by providing a comprehensive database for 
        tracking and storing their data.
