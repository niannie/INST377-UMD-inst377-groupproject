                        SnackTrack will help users monitor their fitness journeys by 
                        providing an accessible platform to log their food, exercise, 
                        and overall health metrics, allowing them to achieve their fitness 
                        goals. Our proposed system will allow users to input personal 
                        details such as their daily caloric intake and exercise routines, 
                        and track them over time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app will provide an easy-to-navigate interface where users 
                        can log their meals and workouts, receive feedback, and view 
                        progress through attractive visualizations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will use the Sport and Fitness API to access reliable nutrition 
                        and fitness data for food items and exercises. This will simplify 
                        the process for users by providing a comprehensive database for 
                        tracking and storing their data.
